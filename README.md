# Welcome


My name is Dr. Rebecca Bornstein-Zieve. I am a postdoctorate fellow working in the laboratory of [Dr. Ofer Yizhar](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/brain-sciences/labs/yizhar/) in the Department of Brain Sciences at the Weizmann Institute. My research interests include early life social behavior, autism, physiology, and neurodevelopment.

I am currently completing the [Python Bootcamp](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-course-2024-04?tab=readme-ov-file) taught by Mr. Gabor Szabo. You can see my homework assignment solutions in this [repository](https://github.com/rebka1989/PythonCourse).
